                        <p class="portfolio__modal-article grid">
                                In the digital age, cybersecurity has become a critical issue. With the increasing number of online transactions and the amount of personal and sensitive information we share online, it's essential to ensure that our data is protected. But who can we trust to keep our information safe? This question has become even more relevant in recent years, as numerous cyberattacks have been reported, and data breaches have become a common occurrence.
                                <br><br>
								One reason not to trust big tech companies is that they have been involved in controversies, such as helping the government against climate activists. This raises questions about privacy and the safety of our information and highlights the importance of having control over the software we use.
                                <br><br>
								The solution to this problem lies in Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS). With FOSS, the source code is available for anyone to review, and we can be confident that the software does what it's supposed to do, and nothing more. However, running your own instance of FOSS may not be practical for everyone, and even if you do, you still need to trust the sysadmin who has access to all your documents.
                                <br><br>
								End-to-end encryption is also crucial in maintaining the security of our data. Client-side encryption is not enough, as it's less effective. End-to-end encryption ensures that the data is encrypted from the sender to the recipient, and only they can access it. FOSS tools like Cryptpad provide end-to-end encryption and allow for online collaboration while keeping the data secure.
                                <br><br>
								However, even with end-to-end encryption, trust is still needed, as the encrypted document is only on the server. To mitigate the risk, the client code should be distributed, but there's still the possibility that the server may delete files or become corrupt. On the other hand, the server is also protected from its users, as the admin doesn't have access to the contents of the documents.
                                <br><br>
								In conclusion, trust is a vital aspect of cybersecurity, and it's essential to be aware of who and what we're entrusting our information to. While FOSS and end-to-end encryption can help us to maintain the security of our data, we need to be mindful of the limitations and risks involved. Ultimately, it's up to everyone to decide whom they trust to keep their information secure.

                        <i class="uil uil-times portfolio__modal-close"></i>
                        <p class="portfolio__modal-article grid">
                            In today's digital landscape, the security of applications and data is more important than ever. With the increasing use of containers for application deployment, it is critical to ensure that these containers are secure from cyber threats.
                            <br><br>
                            One approach to increase the security of containers is through system call interception. System call interception involves intercepting system calls made by an application and modifying them before they reach the kernel. By doing so, we can prevent malicious system calls from being executed, thereby reducing the risk of a security breach.
                            <br><br>
                            The initial targets for interception are key system calls that pose the greatest security risks. For example, the mknod and mknodat system calls, which are used when running docker inside an LXD container, can be intercepted to prevent unauthorized access to the host system. Similarly, the setxattr system call can be intercepted to prevent malicious actors from modifying file permissions or ownership, which could lead to data theft or unauthorized access.
                            <br><br>
                            Another important system call is mount, which is commonly used to mount disks. However, this system call can be unsafe, and therefore, a safer alternative, fuse2fs, is being used to ensure the security of the host system.
                            <br><br>
                            The sched_setscheduler system call is also critical from a cybersecurity perspective. This system call is needed for the android container, but it can also make the container unkillable if not handled correctly. By intercepting this system call, we can prevent attackers from creating unkillable containers, which could lead to a persistent breach.
                            <br><br>
                            Finally, the sysinfo system call is also being targeted due to the fact that some systems, such as Alpine, do not follow standards, which could result in security risks. By intercepting this system call, we can prevent malicious actors from exploiting vulnerabilities in non-standard systems.
                            <br><br>
                            In conclusion, system call interception is a crucial aspect of securing containers in today's cybersecurity landscape. By targeting key system calls that pose the greatest security risks, we can significantly reduce the risk of a security breach and ensure the safe deployment of applications in containers.
