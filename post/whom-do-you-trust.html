								<p>In the digital age, cybersecurity has become a critical issue. With the increasing number of online transactions and the amount of personal and sensitive information we share online, it's essential to ensure that our data is protected. But who can we trust to keep our information safe? This question has become even more relevant in recent years, as numerous cyberattacks have been reported, and data breaches have become a common occurrence.</p>
								<p>One reason not to trust big tech companies is that they have been involved in controversies, such as helping the government against climate activists. This raises questions about privacy and the safety of our information and highlights the importance of having control over the software we use.</p>
								<p>The solution to this problem lies in Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS). With FOSS, the source code is available for anyone to review, and we can be confident that the software does what it's supposed to do, and nothing more. However, running your own instance of FOSS may not be practical for everyone, and even if you do, you still need to trust the sysadmin who has access to all your documents.</p>
								<p>End-to-end encryption is also crucial in maintaining the security of our data. Client-side encryption is not enough, as it's less effective. End-to-end encryption ensures that the data is encrypted from the sender to the recipient, and only they can access it. FOSS tools like Cryptpad provide end-to-end encryption and allow for online collaboration while keeping the data secure.</p>
								<p>However, even with end-to-end encryption, trust is still needed, as the encrypted document is only on the server. To mitigate the risk, the client code should be distributed, but there's still the possibility that the server may delete files or become corrupt. On the other hand, the server is also protected from its users, as the admin doesn't have access to the contents of the documents.</p>
								<p>In conclusion, trust is a vital aspect of cybersecurity, and it's essential to be aware of who and what we're entrusting our information to. While FOSS and end-to-end encryption can help us to maintain the security of our data, we need to be mindful of the limitations and risks involved. Ultimately, it's up to everyone to decide whom they trust to keep their information secure.</p>
