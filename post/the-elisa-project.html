								<p>Cybersecurity has become an increasingly pressing issue in today's digital world, and the need for secure and reliable systems is more important than ever. Linux is a widely used and well-established operating system that offers many features that make it a strong candidate for cybersecurity applications. To further enhance the use of Linux in these applications, the ELISA project was established.</p>
								<p>ELISA provides a platform for collaboration and innovation, bringing together industry leaders, researchers, and developers to work towards a common goal of making Linux a reliable solution for cybersecurity applications. The project offers a comprehensive approach that covers all aspects of Linux used in these applications, including software elements, processes, tools, and documentation.</p>
								<p>Deliverables of the ELISA project include:
									<ul>
										<li>Elements/Software: ELISA provides a comprehensive set of software elements that are essential for building secure Linux-based systems. This includes a Linux kernel and user space components that are optimized for cybersecurity applications.</li>
										<li>Processes: ELISA defines a set of processes and procedures for the development, integration, and deployment of Linux-based systems in cybersecurity applications. These processes ensure that the software is of high quality, secure and reliable.</li>
										<li>Tools: ELISA provides a suite of tools for the development and deployment of Linux-based systems in cybersecurity applications. These tools help developers to quickly and efficiently develop and deploy systems that meet security requirements.</li>
										<li>Documentation: ELISA provides comprehensive documentation that covers all aspects of the project, including the software elements, processes, and tools. This documentation helps developers to understand how to use the project's components and how to integrate them into their own systems.</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>The ELISA project is structured around horizontal and vertical working groups. The horizontal working groups focus on specific areas of the project, such as security architecture, Linux features, tool investigation and code improvement, open-source engineering process, and systems.</p>
								<p>The vertical use cases working groups focus on specific application domains, such as network security, cloud security, and IoT security. These groups work to develop use cases that illustrate how Linux can be used in these domains and how the project's deliverables can be applied to these applications.</p>
								<p>In conclusion, the ELISA project is a valuable resource for anyone looking to use Linux in cybersecurity applications. With its comprehensive approach, the project provides a path forward for the use of Linux in these applications, bringing together industry leaders, researchers, and developers to work towards a common goal. Whether you are an industry professional or a researcher, the ELISA project offers a wealth of resources and opportunities for collaboration and innovation in the field of cybersecurity.</p>
