								<p>In today's digital landscape, the security of applications and data is more important than ever. With the increasing use of containers for application deployment, it is critical to ensure that these containers are secure from cyber threats.</p>
								<p>One approach to increase the security of containers is through system call interception. System call interception involves intercepting system calls made by an application and modifying them before they reach the kernel. By doing so, we can prevent malicious system calls from being executed, thereby reducing the risk of a security breach.</p>
								<p>The initial targets for interception are key system calls that pose the greatest security risks. For example, the <b>mknod</b> and <b>mknodat</b> system calls, which are used when running docker inside an LXD container, can be intercepted to prevent unauthorized access to the host system. Similarly, the <b>setxattr</b> system call can be intercepted to prevent malicious actors from modifying file permissions or ownership, which could lead to data theft or unauthorized access.</p>
								<p>Another important system call is <b>mount</b>, which is commonly used to mount disks. However, this system call can be unsafe, and therefore, a safer alternative, <b>fuse2fs</b>, is being used to ensure the security of the host system.</p>
								<p>The <b>sched_setscheduler</b> system call is also critical from a cybersecurity perspective. This system call is needed for the android container, but it can also make the container unkillable if not handled correctly. By intercepting this system call, we can prevent attackers from creating unkillable containers, which could lead to a persistent breach.</p>
								<p>Finally, the <b>sysinfo</b> system call is also being targeted due to the fact that some systems, such as Alpine, do not follow standards, which could result in security risks. By intercepting this system call, we can prevent malicious actors from exploiting vulnerabilities in non-standard systems.</p>
								<p>In conclusion, system call interception is a crucial aspect of securing containers in today's cybersecurity landscape. By targeting key system calls that pose the greatest security risks, we can significantly reduce the risk of a security breach and ensure the safe deployment of applications in containers.</p>
